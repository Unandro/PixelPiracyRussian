	<String Key = "building">During your adventures, you will come across new parts for your ship. Cannons, training posts, decorative pieces, walls

and ladders are just some of the parts you can procure either through honest means (purchasing them in stores) or less

savoury methods (plundering ships, stealing treasure).



In order to add onto your ship, or restructure it completely, hit SPACEBAR to bring up the MAIN MENU screen. From there,

click on the SHIP SETUP button. You will see a series of green buttons around your ship, these are construction

points where you can build something on your ship. RIGHT clicking a block on your ship REMOVES it, LEFT clicking it ROTATES it.

On the left side of the screen you will see HULL, DECO, FOOD and MISC parts. Here you will be able to view the parts, as

well as the remaining quantitiy. 



Remember, you can ONLY build when docked, it doesn't work on the open sea!</String>



	<String Key = "feed">Your pirates need to be fed and kept happy, otherwise they might turn on you! In order to feed them you must place food stockpiles (purchased in food stores in towns, careful, not EVERY town has a food store!).



	Some foodstuffs (For example: Fish, Meat) require a pirate with the COOK skill in order to prepare food from that stockpile, while others (Watermelons, Fruit) can simply be placed. Pirates are autonomous and will eat when they feel they have time to do so and are hungry enough.



	There are a number of different ways to keep morale high. The quickest is to PAY THEIR SALARY using the corresponding button on the top of the CREW screen. You can pay individually or pay everyone at the same time here. Another method  is to use a MORALE related item such as RUM in the crew screen. You can also purchase rum and stockpile it like food. Winning battles, uncovering treasure, and killing pirates should also increase morale by a small amount.



	Finally, whenever you arrive at a town, your pirates will take some much needed shore leave and head to the nearest tavern, where they will promptly eat and drink to their hearts content (which will cost YOU money!). 

	</String>

	

	<String Key = "cleaning">In order to CLEAN your ship of poo, you must teach the CLEANING skill to a pirate. ITEM SHOPS are available on a handful of islands (Including the beginning island) and there you can learn skills by first purchasing the book, then using it on the CREW screen (hit space-bar and in the menu, click the top button to access it.).



Once on the crew screen you can access individual pirate stats and level them up using TP (training points) that they receive every level. Make sure to save some up, as SKILL BOOKS such as CLEANING require you to use TP to learn the initial skill (EX: a pirate has 2 TP and I purchase the CLEANING skill book. I use it on him and he now has 1 TP left, which I use to boost his Strength in order to increase his damage.).



Pirate skills and stats are a crucial part of game-play, and you should always make sure to build your crew according to your play-style. Just don't forget to invest in skills such as fishing, cooking, cleaning, and repairing as well!

	<String Key = "pets">There are MANY different types of potential pets in the world of Pixel Piracy.



In order to capture them, you must first purchase the RANGED WEAPON: Animal Cage and equip it. It has a 15% chance to capture an animal when thrown, and is

automatically used when attacking an animal.



Once an animal is captured, the PET will show up in the ANIMALS section of the SPACEBAR menu.



Level them up as you would a normal pirate! The MOUNT button on the bottom of the screen (Near the INTERACT button)

will let them mount on top of your captain (when near) in order to be taken onto an island or enemy ship.</String>

	<String Key = "stats">This screen shows an individual pirates PAST, his STATS and his EQUIPPED ITEMS and SKILLS.



At the top of the screen you can PAY SALARY, or PAY ALL salaries, as well as browse different pirates.

Underneath their NAME, you can see that pirate's DESCRIPTION, as well as his PAST.



To the left, you see his TP (Training Points), Current LEVEL, EXP (when full he levels up) HP (Hit Points)

Hunger (If 0 he dies) and Morale (If 0 he turns on you).



STR is Strength, Increasing this value using TP will grant you bonus damage.

VIT is VITALITY, Increasing this value boosts your HP Regeneration.

INT gives you extra EXPERIENCE points every time you gain XP from a source.

DEX increases RANGED damage and your HIT percentage (How often you hit as opposed to miss)

AGI increases your chance to DODGE an enemy attack

LUCK increases your chance to score a critical strike 



PASSIVE EQUIP can be used to equip an item that affects a pirate's stats in a passive manner (Either a 

piece of armour, a hat, etc.) or to use a quick use item (Potion, Bandage, piece of meat, rum etc). Finally,

the PASSIVE EQUIP slot is used to USE AND LEARN SKILLS. See the section on LEARNING SKILLS LIKE CLEANING to

learn how, but to summarize. Purchase a skill book, then use the skill book to learn it (you must have the 

required TP available).



MELEE and RANGED WEAPON, equip your melee and ranged weapons here, mouse over to view stats such as DAMAGE, ATTACK SPEED, KNOCKBACK

RANGE and RANK (Rank being the weapons level. VIEW THE TUTORIAL ON LEVELLING WEAPONS FOR MORE INFORMATION).



SKILLS BOX: Every pirate starts with BASIC ATTACK at L0, and the rest of the box is available for you to 

learn new skills.



GROUP: Set a pirate to a group (number key) here. Useful when you have different pirates attending different

tasks on the ship. As a rule of thumb, number key 3 selects your CREW in order to move them using the right mouse button.



GRAPPLE: Set this pirate to be unable to grapple off the ship



CANNONS: Will this pirate automatically use cannons?



RETREAT: Will this pirate fall back to the ship if his health gets low.



</String>



	<String Key = "tips">[ffff55]HOW CAN I FIND XXXX SHOP??[-]



In the world map, you can mouse over a TOWN in order to see what shop types there are (Tavern, Skills, Weapons, etc).

Remember that you can only see what shops are in towns you have previously been in.



[ffff55]WHAT ENCOUNTERS SHOULD A BEGGINER TAKE ON? [-]



You should DEFINITELY start out by taking on Level 1 SHIP encounters, as ISLAND encounters tend to be more difficult.

Go towards island encounters only once you have plundered a few ships, levelled your crew a few times, and have a basic understanding of combat.



[ffff55]WHERE DO I SEE WHAT ITEMS OR WEAPONS I AM OBTAINING?[-]



In the BOTTOM RIGHT hand corner of the screen you can see what loot you are collecting in real time!





[ffff55]WHAT ARE SOME BEGGINER TIPS?[-]



Try hiring a crew-member in the local tavern and attack a ship. Use the PLUNDER option after the battle to gather some gold 

and ship parts (that you can sell in a ship part store), in order to purchase the CLEANING skill book from the starting town.



Equip your captain with it in order to clean the poo on deck and keep your morale high! Remember that you need to pay

your crew their salary to keep their morale up if you see the face above their head turn red!



ALWAYS keep a few pieces of watermelon in your ships inventory, you never know when you'll find a new ship, only to steal

it and then remember you have no food left to place! 





Don't be afraid of using skill points! Remember to spend TP when you get them, but to always keep one or two free in case

you come across an awesome skill book! Skills COST TP, which means that having a few on hand for when you find a PARRY book

might just let you equip it in time for an important battle!



ROCKS ROCKS ROCKS! If you come across rocks, EQUIP THEM. They work well as starting ranged weapons, don't run out, and let

you hit an enemy before getting in close for the kill!



PETS! Don't underestimate the power of an animal cage! They only work rarely, but when they do, you get a new pet, which 

acts as another member of your crew, along with his own skills! Pets can really change battles!



LOOT! Remember to check and see what new loot you have obtained after battles. Often times, you may come across a rare passive 

equip or incredible weapon without even knowing it during the heat of battle. Make sure to sell excess items to get more money!

</String>



	<String Key = "travel">By hitting the [ffff55]spacebar[-], you can bring up the general MENU screen. Once there, [ffff55]click on WORLD MAP[-]. 



[ffff55]Select a destination[-] and the map will plot out the course. [ffff55]Click on the button in the TOP LEFT hand of the screen to travel[-].

The percentage in the TOP RIGHT that appears while travelling is how close you are to your destination (with 100% 

being arrival).



Expect the unexpected while travelling!

</String>



	<String Key = "weapons">All weapons, both RANGED and MELEE, can be upgraded to increase their stats. In order to do so you must find an appropriate

GRINDSTONE item. There are RANGED grindstones and MELEE grindstones. Each time you use one, there is a chance the grindstone

will level up your item, increasing it's stats. The more successful grindstones you use, the lower the percentage of success.



[ffff55]HOW TO USE RANGED WEAPONS[-]



There are two different types of weapons in the game, MELEE and RANGED. Ranged weapons must be equipped in a RANGED slot

in the YOUR CREW selection screen (Selecting a pirate), you can click on the RANGED WEAPON slot and equip the item, which

is then used automatically at range prior to closing in to MELEE distance. A good tactic is to equip rocks, as they make

for decent damage dealers prior to obtaining more powerful ranged weapons. They do NOT run out.</String>



	<String Key = "encounters">WHAT ENCOUNTERS SHOULD A BEGGINER TAKE ON? 



You should DEFINITELY start out by taking on Level 1 SHIP encounters, as ISLAND encounters tend to be more difficult.

</String>



	<String Key = "escape">HOW TO ESCAPE AN ISLAND BATTLE



Island battles are unique in that you can escape them AT ANY TIME. All you need to do if you find yourself in a difficult

situation is send everyone back onto the ship, go to the world map, and select a new destination! Click sail and you leave!

A good idea might be to send a scouting party down to an island if there is a nearby treasure, then high-tail it out of there

once trouble arrives!

</String>



	<String Key = "fishing">FISHING



Your pirates can be taught to fish. In order to do so they need the required skill, as well as a fishing rod, which is

available at SOME weapon stores (relatively rare!).

</String>



	<String Key = "hiring">HOW TO SHOP/HIRE CREWMEMBERS



Each store or tavern can be accessed by moving your CAPTAIN to the centre of it and hitting the SPACEBAR. You will know when you are in the right place because a big flashing button that says PRESS SPACE TO INTERACT appears.</String>



	<String Key = "objective">What is the objective of the game?



Your objective is to become the most fearsome pirate this world has seen. How do you go about doing that? Plunder, kill,

steal, gather a massive crew and eventually defeat all of the four LEGENDARY pirate lords roaming these parts.</String>



	<String Key = "obtained">WHERE DO I SEE WHAT ITEMS OR WEAPONS I AM OBTAINING?



In the BOTTOM RIGHT hand corner of the screen you can see what loot you are collecting in real time!

</String>



	<String Key = "quest">QUESTS



In certain towns there is a BOUNTY BOARD or BOUNTY QUEST GIVER who will send you off to kill a certain person of ill repute.

Take care to note what island he is on, and who he is, then find the ruffian for a reward and XP. Take care, these missions

are for well-trained crews!

</String>



	<String Key = "treasure">HOW TO OPEN A TREASURE CHEST



During your travels, you will uncover many treasure chests. In order to open them you must use the ORANGE INTERACT

button located on the bottom bar (It looks kind of like an exclamation mark and is near the CAPTURE and PLUNDER buttons.)

	<String Key = "EndCredits">How does it feel? To be the most bad-ass pirate from here to Tortuga, that is. To have taken on the four Legendary pirate captains and lived to tell the tale. I bet it feels pretty sweet.



Taverns across the land sing shanties in your name. Sailors in every port know they can either join you or be crushed under your boot. Your treasury overflows with gold and valuables.



I bet it's also lonely at the top, with this corner of the world bowing to your might. What will you do next? Continue your plunderous ways until there's nothing left to plunder? Build the biggest pirate ship the world has ever seen? Or perhaps retire to a deserted island with a hammock and a bottle of the finest rum? That's up to you now, Captain...
